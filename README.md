# Simple JavaScript Task List

## Overview

This is a basic task list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add new tasks to a list and delete tasks once they are completed. This project serves as a fundamental example of front-end web development using core web technologies.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can type in a new task and click the "Add" button (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Each task in the list has a "Delete" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the web page.
- CSS: For styling the visual appearance of the application.
- JavaScript: For handling the interactivity and dynamic updates to the task list.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    If you haven't already cloned this repository to your local machine, you can do so using the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository on GitHub.

2.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Navigate to the project folder on your computer and open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

3.  **Start Using the Task List:**
    The task list application will open in your browser, and you can start adding and deleting tasks.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:
task-list/
├── index.html # The main HTML file containing the structure.
├── style.css # The CSS file containing the styling.
└── script.js # The JavaScript file containing the functionality.
└── README.md # This file, providing information about the project.

## Potential Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements to this task list:

- **Prioritizing Tasks:** Add a way to set and display task priorities.
- **More Advanced Styling:** Improve the visual design and user experience.
