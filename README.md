# Simple JavaScript Task List

## Overview

This is a basic task list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add new tasks to a list and delete tasks once they are completed. This project serves as a fundamental example of front-end web development using core web technologies.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Users can type in a new task and click the "Add" button (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
* **Delete Tasks:** Each task in the list has a "Delete" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.

## Technologies Used

* HTML: For structuring the web page.
* CSS: For styling the visual appearance of the application.
* JavaScript: For handling the interactivity and dynamic updates to the task list.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    If you haven't already cloned this repository to your local machine, you can do so using the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository on GitHub.

2.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Navigate to the project folder on your computer and open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

3.  **Start Using the Task List:**
    The task list application will open in your browser, and you can start adding and deleting tasks.
