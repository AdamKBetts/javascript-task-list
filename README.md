## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing all the styling rules for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the application's logic and functionality.

## Refactoring and Improvements

During the development process, the following key improvements were made:

- **JavaScript Refactoring:** The JavaScript code was reorganized into functions for better readability and maintainability. Event listeners were grouped, and logic was encapsulated in specific functions.
- **CSS Enhancement:** The CSS was tidied up using logical sections and CSS variables for consistent styling and easy customization of colors. A modern and clean user interface with a tech-inspired dark theme was implemented.
- **Removal of `@extend`:** The non-standard `@extend` rule was replaced with standard CSS practices using multiple class names in the HTML for better compatibility.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Focus styles were enhanced for better keyboard navigation.

## Technologies Used
